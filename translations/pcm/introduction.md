![Edge AI Introduction](../../translated_images/pcm/cover.eb18d1b9605d754b.webp)

Welcome to di journey wey go carry you enter **Edge Artificial Intelligence** – na new way wey dey bring AI power go di place wey data dey happen and decision need to dey made. Dis introduction go help you sabi why Edge AI na di future of smart computing and how you fit learn how to use am well.

## Wetin be Edge AI?

Edge AI na big change from di normal cloud-based AI wey dey process for server to **local, on-device intelligence**. Instead of to dey send data go far server, Edge AI dey process di information directly for di edge devices – like smartphone, IoT sensors, industrial machine, autonomous motor, and embedded systems.

### Di Edge AI Paradigm

```
Traditional AI:     Device → Cloud → Processing → Response → Device
Edge AI:           Device → Local Processing → Immediate Response
```

Dis new way dey remove di waka go cloud, e dey make:
- **Quick response** (sub-millisecond latency)

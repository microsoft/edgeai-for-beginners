Also, e fit join existing system like CMS or CRM without to rebuild infrastructure.  
Speaker 1: Compared to ChatGPT, wetin make Ollama stand out?  
Speaker 2: ChatGPT advantage na cloud service scalability and global model training data, but Ollama focus more on privacy and local control. If your project need strict data protection or offline use, Ollama better choice; but if you need large scale deployment and global language support, ChatGPT fit better.  
Speaker 1: I understand. So, for normal users, e get how pesin go take start with Ollama?  
Speaker 2: E no hard as dat. Installing and configuring Ollama na like Docker, e good for people wey sabi some tech work. E get detailed docs and community support so even beginners fit learn step by step. But for people wey no too sabi AI model at all, e go need small time to learn.  
Speaker 1: Thank you very much for your explanation! Lastly, any advice you get for our listeners?

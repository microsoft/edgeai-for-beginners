* 📝 **Your Script**: Di `podcast.txt` file from Act 2 (inside `../03.Application/`)

**Pro Tip**: Dis step need better internet connection to download di pre-trained model. Make you carry coffee! ☕

## Make We Go! The Easy Way 🎬

We don make am stupid simple. One shell script dey do everything.

### The Process

1. **Make am executable**:
```bash
chmod +x run_vibe_voice.sh

## Your Mission 🎯

### Task 1: Create Content
Edit `../03.Application/podcast.txt` wit conversation between two people. Make e be about tech, hobbies, anything! Just make am conversational.

**Format Example**:
```
Speaker 1: Hey! Did you hear about the new AI model?
Speaker 2: No way! Tell me more!
Speaker 1: It's called...
```

### Task 2: Generate Audio
Run di script and watch magic happen. First time go take longer (because model dey download).

### Task 3: Listen & Analyze
- E sound natural?
- Di speakers get different voice?
- Di turn-taking smooth?
- Any robot voice moment?

### Task 4: Experiment (For di Brave)
Edit `run_vibe_voice.sh` and change `--speaker_names` to try different voice combinations. VibeVoice get plenty pre-trained voices!

**Bonus Challenge**: Try 3-speaker conversation! 🎆

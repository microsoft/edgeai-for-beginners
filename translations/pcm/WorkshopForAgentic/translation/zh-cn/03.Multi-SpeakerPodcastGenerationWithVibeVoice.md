## Make We Start! Easy Way 🎬

We make am super simple. One shell script dey handle everything.

### Steps

1. **Make am executable**:
```bash
chmod +x run_vibe_voice.sh

```
说话人 1：嘿！你听说新的 AI 模型了吗？
说话人 2：不会吧！告诉我更多！
说话人 1：它叫...
```

### Task 2: Generate Audio
Run the script, see the magic. First time go take longer (model downloading time).

### Task 3: Listen and Analyse
- E sound natural?
- Do speakers get different voices?
- Na smooth turn-talking?
- Any robot moments?

### Task 4: Experiment (for brave people)
Edit `run_vibe_voice.sh` and change `--speaker_names` to try different voice combos. VibeVoice get plenty pretrained voices!

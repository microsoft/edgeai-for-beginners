# Act Two: Build Your Podcast Production Team 🎬

![lab2](../../../../../translated_images/lab2.48444b9d549e7863.pcm.png)

## Plot Thickens

Alex (your AI assistant from Act One) good, but one AI fit no run whole podcast studio. You need one *team*:
- 🔍 **Research Agent**: dey search internet for fresh info
- ✍️ **Script Agent**: turn research into interesting conversation
- 👤 **You (Editor)**: approve script or send am back for rewrite

Welcome to **AI Agent Orchestration** — you be director for your own AI team. Think Avengers, but for podcast production.

## Wetin be Agent Orchestration? (Simple version)

Imagine say you dey run restaurant. You no go do everything youself, abi? You get:
- 🍳 Chef dey cook food
- 👨‍🍳 Sous chef dey prepare
- 👩‍🍳 Waiter dey serve food

Agent orchestration na same idea, but with AI. Each agent get im special skill, you go coordinate dem to reach bigger goal. No single agent go too tired, work go faster.

### Band Analogy 🎸

Your AI agents na like band:
- **Lead singer**: main agent wey dey handle customer-facing task dem
- **Drummer**: dey keep rhythm, handle backend stuff
- **Bassist**: dey support everybody, dey get data
- **You (Band manager)**: dey coordinate all!

No coordination? Na noise be dat. Coordination dey? Na sweet music.

### Why E Matter

One AI agent wey try do everything = burnout. Specialists agents wey dey work together = unlocked efficiency! 🚀

**Real talk**: you remember wen you try research, write and edit your podcast by yourself? E no too good. With orchestration, each agent handle wetin e sabi well. You just do final decision.

**Real world example**: Customer support bot sabi when to handle billing vs tech issues vs when to call human. Na orchestration dat one be!

## Agent vs Workflow: Wetin Different?

Think like dis:

### 🤖 AI Agent = Jazz Musician
- **Improvises decisions** based on wetin e hear
- **Improvises solutions** with him tools
- **Thinks** with LLM brain
- **Adapts** to anything wey you throw at am

### 🎵 Workflow = Orchestra playing Classical Music
- **Follows score** (predefined steps)
- **Predictable** execution path
- **Coordinates** many agents, humans, systems
- **Structured** like recipe

**Magic**: Workflow *orchestrates* agents! You build workflow tell agents when to act. Best of both worlds. 🎭

## Three Ways to Coordinate Your AI Team

### 1. 🎯 Centralized (You be boss)

One main agent dey give orders. Think like you dey manage team — you decide who do wetin and when.

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Clear leadership (no confusion)
- ✅ Consistent decisions
- ✅ Easy to debug

**Good for**:
- Customer service routing ("Na billing or tech support?")
- Content approval workflow ("This script don pass?")
- Podcast production (exactly wetin we dey build!)

### 2. 🤝 Decentralized (Agents self-organize)

Agents dey talk direct to each other and solve problem as group. Like all people dey coordinate for group chat.

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Easy to scale (add more agents anytime)
- ✅ No single point of failure
- ✅ Natural collaboration among agents

**Good for**:
- Research teams (each agent explore different sources)
- Brainstorm meetings
- Distributed problem solving

### 3. 🔀 Hybrid (Best of both worlds)

You set overall direction, but agents get freedom for tasks self-organize. Like CEO wey trust team.

**Perfect for**: Complex projects wey need control and flexibility.

## Microsoft Agent Framework: Your Orchestration Toolkit 🧰

Time to build! Na wetin you go use:

### Building blocks

#### 1. 🧱 Executors (Your workers)
- **Wetin dem be**: individual processing units — fit be agents or custom logic
- **Wetin dem do**: receive input, do work, produce output
- **Imagine dem like**: workstations for assembly line

#### 2. ➡️ Edges (Connections)
- **Wetin dem be**: paths between executors
- **Wetin dem do**: control message flow ("After A, go B")
- **Imagine dem like**: arrows for flowchart

#### 3. 🗺️ Workflows (Overall plan)
- **Wetin dem be**: full graph of executors + edges
- **Wetin dem do**: define whole process from start to finish
- **Imagine dem like**: blueprint for your production process

### Cool features wey you go like

**🛡️ Type safety**: Messages between agents get type checks. No "Oops, wrong data type" surprise.

**🔀 Flexible routing**:
- If-then conditions ("If approved, publish; else rewrite")
- Parallel processing (multiple agents work at same time)
- Dynamic paths (workflow adjusts per results)

**🔌 External integrations**:
- Connect to APIs
- Add human-in-the-loop checkpoints (you approve before publish)
- Build request/response flows

**💾 Checkpoints**: Save progress! If something crash, continue from where you stop.

**🤝 Multi-agent coordination**:
- Run agents in sequence (A → B → C)
- Run concurrently (A + B + C together)
- Handoffs between agents
- Collaborative handling

## Best Practices (Pro Tips) 🎯

### 1. Keep it modular
Each agent suppose well do one thing. No try make "super agent" wey do everything — you go regret am when debugging.

### 2. Plan for failure
Agents go make mistakes. Network go fail. Build error handling and fallback plans. Future you go thank you.

### 3. Monitor everything
Track wetin your agents dey do. Use DevUI (we go show am!) to view running workflows.

### 4. Optimize message size
No send big big files between agents. Keep messages small for better speed.

### 5. Choose right pattern
Want control? Choose centralized. Want scale? Choose decentralized. No sure? Choose hybrid!

## DevUI: Your Workflow Debugger 🔍

### Wetin be DevUI?

DevUI na playground to test your agents and workflows. E be web interface wey you fit:
- 👀 Watch your workflows run
- 💬 Chat directly with agents
- 🔍 Debug wen tins no work
- 📊 View traces and performance metrics

> **Important**: DevUI na for development only! No use am for production. Think am as your local test environment.

### Wetin make am great

- **🖥️ Interactive Web UI**: click, type, test — no command line needed
- **📁 Drag and drop ready**: upload files, test with different inputs
- **📂 Auto discovery**: point to folder, e go find all agents automatically
- **📋 No setup mode**: register agents in code, no folder structure needed
- **🔌 OpenAI compatible**: works with OpenAI SDK (compatibility win!)
- **👁️ Built-in tracing**: see exactly wetin your agents dey do

### How inputs work

DevUI smart about inputs:

- **Testing agent?** You get textbox and file upload button
- **Testing workflow?** UI generate input fields based on your workflow expectations

Na magic, but na good code. ✨

## Your Mission: Build Podcast Studio 🎬

### Task 1: Use DevUI to create single agent

📂 [01.AgentDevUI](../../../../../WorkshopForAgentic/code/02.Workflow/01.AgentDevUI)

**Challenge**: Before build full team, make we test DevUI with one agent: web search expert.

**Wetin you go build**: 
One research agent wey fit search internet for podcast topics. You go test am on DevUI web interface `http://localhost:8090`.

**Skills you go learn**: 
- 🚀 Launch agent on DevUI
- 🔍 Real-time test agent responses
- 🛠️ Build custom tool (web search)
- 📊 Enable tracing to debug issues
- 🖥️ Use interactive Web UI

**Code**: 
- `agent.py`: your SearchAgent with web search superpower
- Use OllamaChatClient to connect Qwen
- Implement `web_search()` tool function
- Start with `serve()` — DevUI open automatically

**Winning condition**: Ask your agent "Wetin hot for AI field?" watch am search internet! 🎉

### Task 2: Build multi-agent workflow

📂 [02.WorkflowDevUI](../../../../../WorkshopForAgentic/code/02.Workflow/02.WorkflowDevUI)

**Challenge**: Now real fun don start! Build full podcast production workflow:
1. 🔍 **Search Agent** → research your topic
2. ✍️ **Script Agent** → write conversation between two hosts (in Chinese!)
3. 👤 **Review executor** → ask you to approve or reject
4. 🔄 **Loop back** → if reject, rewrite per your feedback

**Skills you go learn**:
- 🧱 Create specialised agents for different tasks
- 🔗 Connect agents with WorkflowBuilder
- 🔀 Implement approval loop (human-in-the-loop!)
- 🚦 Conditional routing (if approve vs reject)
- 🔧 Build custom executors for business logic

**Workflow**:
```
SearchAgent → ScriptAgent → ReviewExecutor
                             ↑          ↓ (如果被拒绝)
                             ←─────────
```

**Code**:
- `search_agent/agent.py`: your research expert
- `generate_script_agent/agent.py`: your script writer (write in Chinese!)
- `workflow/workflow.py`: where orchestration magic happens
- `main.py`: launch everything in DevUI

**Winning condition**: Give topic, review script, reject once to test loop, then approve! 🎉

### Task 3: Build console app

📂 [03.Application](../../../../../WorkshopForAgentic/code/02.Workflow/03.Application)

**Challenge**: Turn your workflow from DevUI into cool terminal app with colored output, spinner and file saving. Dis na production ready!

**Skills you go learn**:
- ⚡ Run workflows programmatically (no DevUI)
- 📡 Use event-driven architecture with streaming
- 🎨 Create nice terminal UI (colors, spinner, progress bar)
- 💾 Save final script to file
- 🔄 Handle async workflows with Python's asyncio

**Wetin e do**:
1. Ask your podcast topic
2. Show live progress ("Search Agent dey work...")
3. Display generated script with colors
4. Ask for your approval
5. Save approved script to `podcast.txt`

**Code**:
- `podcast_app.py`: your main app with event handling
- `workflow.py`: reuse workflow from Task 2
- Handle events: `AgentRunUpdateEvent`, `RequestInfoEvent`, `WorkflowOutputEvent`
- Use ANSI colors for terminal styling

**Win condition**: Run di app, create podcast script, see am save! You don build real tool.🚀

## Wetin you don sabi 🏆

After second act, you fit:

- ✅ Arrange plenty AI agents like boss
- ✅ Build workflows wey get order and condition logic
- ✅ Add human approval checkpoints
- ✅ Use DevUI test and debug workflow
- ✅ Create production-ready console app
- ✅ Handle error well well for complex system
- ✅ Choose correct orchestration pattern for any project

## When tins go wrong 🔧

### "My workflow too complex!"
**Solution**: Breakdown am into smaller sub-workflows. Each workflow suppose do one thing well. If need, link dem together.

### "I no fit track wetin dey happen!"
**Solution**: Use workflow checkpoints to save state. Enable tracing for DevUI to see each step.

### "One agent error go crash everything!"
**Solution**: Add error boundaries. Each agent suppose handle im own failure and get fallback behavior.

### "E too slow"
**Solution**: Any agents fit run parallel? Sequential workflows easy but slow. Find parallelization chances!

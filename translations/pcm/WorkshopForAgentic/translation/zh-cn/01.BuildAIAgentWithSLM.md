![lab1](../../../../../translated_images/pcm/lab1.1dd5210a7d114e2e.webp)

## Challenge

You dey launch "Future Bytes," your new tech podcast. Di first episode na about di latest AI breakthrough, but you get only 24 hours to:
1. Research di topic
2. Find trusted sources
3. Write beta engaging script
4. Make am sound natural

**Plot twist**: You no need do am alone. You go build your first AI helper wey fit help you do all dis. Make we call am Alex — your research partner wey no dey tire, no need sleep.

## Why Choose Small Language Models? (Spoiler: Dem sweet)

Think small language models (SLM) as personal AI wey dey run for *your* computer. No cloud, no monthly fee, no gbas gbos with data sharing.

**Why SLM dey 🔥:**
- **🏠 E dey run for your machine**: Laptop, desktop, even powerful Raspberry Pi
- **💸 No ongoing cost**: No API fee go chop your pocket money
- **🔒 Privacy first**: Your data no go ever comot for your device
- **⚡ Super fast**: No network lag, response quick quick
- **🪦 Lightweight**: 1 billion to 10 billion params vs big models wey get 100 billion+

**Popular SLM**: Qwen 3, Phi-4, Gemma 3 (Dis workshop dey use Qwen)

## Your Toolkit

### Ollama: Your AI Model Manager

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) na like Steam for AI models. Download, run and manage models with simple commands.

**Wetyn cool about am:**
- One command to download and run any model
- Works for Mac, Windows, Linux
- If you get GPU, e go use am automatically
- Memory saving no be small

### Microsoft Agent Framework: Where Di Magic Happen

[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) na your playground to build AI agents wey fit:

- 💬 Chat and remember wetin una dey talk
- 🛠️ Use custom tools (like search internet or check weather)
- 🧠 Reason step by step for complex problems
- 🤝 Work as team with other agents
- 🔌 Connect to different AI providers (OpenAI, Ollama, Azure)

**Building blocks:**
- **Agents**: AI helpers with specific jobs
- **Tools**: Special abilities you give dem
- **Memory**: So dem no go forget your conversation
- **Reasoning**: Teach dem to think, no just respond

## Your Training Montage: 4 Tasks

### Task 1: Create Your First Agent

📓 [Open Notebook](../../code/01.BasicAgent/00.BasicAgent-agent.ipynb)

**Task**: Build Alex, your podcast script writing AI. Alex need to generate dialog for two hosts to discuss tech topics.

**You go learn:**
- How to wake up AI agent (e easier pass wake your bed on Monday)
- Give am personality and instructions
- Make am generate real podcast script
- Understand wetin e reply you

**Winning condition**: Alex go create script for your "Future Bytes" pilot episode about AI! 🎯

### Task 2: Give Alex Superpowers (Tools!)

📓 [Open Notebook](../../code/01.BasicAgent/01.BasicAgent-tools.ipynb)

**Task**: Alex dey smart but e no sabi today weather or the time now. Make we give am tools to solve this problem!

**You go learn:**
- Build custom Python functions as "tools"
- Make Alex decide *when* to use which tool
- Watch am solve problems on e own
- Combine many tools for complex tasks

**Winning condition**: Ask "How weather for Tokyo?" and Alex go find di answer on e own! ☁️

### Task 3: Teach Alex to Think

📓 [Open Notebook](../../code/01.BasicAgent/02.BasicAgent-reasoning.ipynb)

**Task**: Make Alex show how e dey work. When solving problems, you go like see *how* e dey reason and no be just answer.

**You go learn:**
- Activate "reasoning mode" (just like for maths class demo your work)
- See step by step thinking process for Alex
- Understand chains of thought prompts
- Debug when Alex dey confused

**Winning condition**: Ask hard math question, see Alex reason am! 🧠

### Task 4: Connect Alex to Internet

📓 [Open Notebook](../../code/01.BasicAgent/03.BasicAgent-websearch.ipynb)

**Task**: Alex knowledge get expiry date. Make we connect am to internet to get real time info!

**You go learn:**
- Build custom web search tool
- Integrate external APIs
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Get info wey pass Alex training data

**Winning condition**: Ask for today tech news and get latest result! 📰

## Before You Start 🚀

**Must get gear:**
- Python 3.10+ installed
- Ollama dey run (check with `ollama --version`)
- VS Code with Python extension
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB better if you want smooth experience)

## Task Order

Complete notebooks in order to get full experience:

1. [00.BasicAgent-agent.ipynb](../../code/01.BasicAgent/00.BasicAgent-agent.ipynb) — Meet Alex (your first agent)
2. [01.BasicAgent-tools.ipynb](../../code/01.BasicAgent/01.BasicAgent-tools.ipynb) — Time to upgrade!
3. [02.BasicAgent-reasoning.ipynb](../../code/01.BasicAgent/02.BasicAgent-reasoning.ipynb) — Teach Alex to think
4. [03.BasicAgent-websearch.ipynb](../../code/01.BasicAgent/03.BasicAgent-websearch.ipynb) — Unlock internet access!

## Wetin You Go Master

After Act One, you go fit:

- ✅ Run AI models on your own hardware (no cloud needed!)
- ✅ Build agents with custom personality and skills
- ✅ Give agents tools to solve real problems
- ✅ Make agents show their reasoning
- ✅ Connect agents to external data sources
- ✅ Debug when tins no work

## When Tins Go Wrong (and How to Fix) 🔧

### "Alex no fit load! Memory no reach!"
**Fix**: Your computer dey struggle. Try close other apps, or switch to smaller model. 8GB RAM na minimum.

### "Alex slow wella"
**Fix**: Enable GPU acceleration for Ollama settings. Or reduce context window size. Speed demon mode activated! 🏎️

### "Tool no work!"
**Fix**: Check your function signature well well. Alex need correct type hints to understand tool function. Think am as giving clear instruction.

## Next Step: Act Two 🎬

You get one agent. But how about a *team* of agents work together? For Act Two, you go build complete podcast production team:
- **Research agent**: Find best sources  
- **Writing agent**: Make perfect scripts  
- **Editing (you!)**: Approve or request changes

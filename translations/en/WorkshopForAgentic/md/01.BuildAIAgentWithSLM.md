# Act 1: Meet Your AI Research Assistant 🤖

![lab1](../../../../translated_images/en/lab1.1dd5210a7d114e2e.webp)

## The Challenge

You're launching "Future Bytes," your new tech podcast. Episode 1 is about the latest AI breakthroughs, but you've got 24 hours to:
1. Research the topic
2. Find credible sources
3. Write a compelling script
4. Make it sound natural

**Plot twist**: You don't have to do it alone. You're about to build your first AI assistant who can help with all of this. Let's call them Alex — your tireless research partner who never needs sleep.

## Why Small Language Models? (Spoiler: They're Awesome)

Think of Small Language Models (SLMs) as your personal AI that lives on *your* computer. No cloud, no monthly fees, no sketchy data sharing.

**Why SLMs are 🔥:**
- **🏠 Runs on Your Machine**: Laptop, desktop, even a beefy Raspberry Pi
- **💸 Zero Ongoing Costs**: No API fees eating your lunch money
- **🔒 Privacy First**: Your data never leaves your device
- **⚡ Lightning Fast**: No internet lag, instant responses
- **🪦 Lightweight**: 1B-10B parameters vs 100B+ for the big guys

**Popular SLMs**: Qwen 3, Phi-4, Gemma 3 (we're using Qwen for this workshop)

## Your Toolkit

### Ollama: Your AI Model Manager

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is like Steam for AI models. Download, run, and manage models with simple commands.

**What makes it cool:**
- One command to download and run any model
- Works on Mac, Windows, Linux
- Automatically uses your GPU if you have one
- Super memory-efficient

### Microsoft Agent Framework: Where the Magic Happens

[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) is your playground for building AI agents that can:

- 💬 Chat and remember what you talked about
- 🛠️ Use custom tools (like searching the web or checking weather)
- 🧠 Think through complex problems step-by-step
- 🤝 Work with other agents as a team
- 🔌 Connect to different AI providers (OpenAI, Ollama, Azure)

**The Building Blocks:**
- **Agents**: Your AI assistants with specific jobs
- **Tools**: Special abilities you give them
- **Memory**: So they don't forget your conversation
- **Reasoning**: Teaching them to think, not just respond

## Your Training Montage: 4 Missions

### Mission 1: Create Your First Agent

📓 [Open Notebook](../code/01.BasicAgent/00.BasicAgent-agent.ipynb)

**The Quest**: Build Alex, your podcast scriptwriter AI. Alex needs to generate dialogue between two hosts discussing tech topics.

**What You'll Learn**:
- How to wake up an AI agent (it's easier than waking up on Monday)
- Give it personality and instructions
- Make it generate actual podcast scripts
- Understand what it's saying back to you

**Victory Condition**: Alex creates a script for your "Future Bytes" pilot episode about AI! 🎯

### Mission 2: Give Alex Superpowers (Tools!)

📓 [Open Notebook](../code/01.BasicAgent/01.BasicAgent-tools.ipynb)

**The Quest**: Alex is smart, but it doesn't know today's weather or what time it is. Let's fix that by giving it tools!

**What You'll Learn**:
- Create custom Python functions as "tools"
- Let Alex decide *when* to use which tool
- Watch it autonomously solve problems
- Combine multiple tools for complex tasks

**Victory Condition**: Ask "What's the weather in Tokyo?" and Alex figures it out on its own! ☁️

### Mission 3: Teach Alex to Think

📓 [Open Notebook](../code/01.BasicAgent/02.BasicAgent-reasoning.ipynb)

**The Quest**: Make Alex show its work. When solving problems, you want to see *how* it thinks, not just the answer.

**What You'll Learn**:
- Activate "reasoning mode" (it's like showing your work in math class)
- See Alex's step-by-step thought process
- Understand chain-of-thought prompting
- Debug when Alex gets confused

**Victory Condition**: Ask a tricky math problem and watch Alex think it through! 🧠

### Mission 4: Connect Alex to the Internet

📓 [Open Notebook](../code/01.BasicAgent/03.BasicAgent-websearch.ipynb)

**The Quest**: Alex's knowledge has a cutoff date. Let's connect it to the web for real-time info!

**What You'll Learn**:
- Build a custom web search tool
- Integrate external APIs
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Get info beyond Alex's training data

**Victory Condition**: Ask about today's tech news and get fresh results! 📰

## Before You Start 🚀

**Required Gear**:
- Python 3.10+ installed
- Ollama running (check with `ollama --version`)
- VS Code with Python extension
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB if you want smooth vibes)

## Mission Order

Follow the notebooks in sequence for the full story:

1. [00.BasicAgent-agent.ipynb](../code/01.BasicAgent/00.BasicAgent-agent.ipynb) — Meet Alex (your first agent)
2. [01.BasicAgent-tools.ipynb](../code/01.BasicAgent/01.BasicAgent-tools.ipynb) — Power-up time!
3. [02.BasicAgent-reasoning.ipynb](../code/01.BasicAgent/02.BasicAgent-reasoning.ipynb) — Teach Alex to think
4. [03.BasicAgent-websearch.ipynb](../code/01.BasicAgent/03.BasicAgent-websearch.ipynb) — Internet access unlocked!

## What You'll Master

After Act 1, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Run AI models on your own hardware (no cloud needed!)
- ✅ Build agents with custom personalities and skills
- ✅ Give agents tools to solve real-world problems
- ✅ Make agents show their reasoning process
- ✅ Connect agents to external data sources
- ✅ Debug when things go sideways

## When Things Break (And How to Fix Them) 🔧

### "Alex won't load! Out of memory!"
**The Fix**: Your computer's struggling. Try closing other apps, or switch to a smaller model. 8GB RAM is the bare minimum.

### "Alex is soooo slow"
**The Fix**: Enable GPU acceleration in Ollama settings. Or reduce the context window size. Speed demon mode activated! 🏎️

### "Tools aren't working!"
**The Fix**: Double-check your function signatures. Alex needs proper type hints to understand what the tool does. Think of it like giving clear instructions.

## Next Up: Act 2 🎬

You've got one agent. But what if you had a *team* of agents working together? In Act 2, you'll build your full podcast production crew:
- **Researcher Agent**: Finds the best sources
- **Writer Agent**: Crafts the perfect script  
- **Editor (You!)**: Approves or requests changes

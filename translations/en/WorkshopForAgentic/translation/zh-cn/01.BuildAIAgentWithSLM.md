# Act 1: Meet Your AI Research Assistant 🤖

![lab1](../../../../../translated_images/lab1.1dd5210a7d114e2e.en.png)

## Challenge

You are launching "Future Bytes," your new tech podcast. The first episode is about the latest AI breakthroughs, but you only have 24 hours to:
1. Research the topic
2. Find credible sources
3. Write an engaging script
4. Make it sound natural

**Plot twist**: You don’t have to do it alone. You’re about to build your first AI assistant that can help with all of this. Let’s call it Alex — your tireless research partner who never needs to sleep.

## Why Small Language Models? (Spoiler: They’re awesome)

Think of small language models (SLM) as a personal AI running *on your* computer. No cloud, no monthly fees, no shady data sharing.

**Why SLMs are so 🔥:**
- **🏠 Runs on your machine**: Laptop, desktop, even a powerful Raspberry Pi
- **💸 Zero ongoing cost**: No API fees eating your pocket money
- **🔒 Privacy first**: Your data never leaves your device
- **⚡ Lightning-fast**: No network lag, instant responses
- **🪦 Lightweight**: 1-10 billion parameters vs large models' 100+ billion

**Popular SLMs**: Qwen 3, Phi-4, Gemma 3 (we use Qwen in this workshop)

## Your Toolkit

### Ollama: Your AI Model Manager

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is like Steam for AI models. Download, run, and manage models with simple commands.

**What’s cool:**
- One command to download and run any model
- Available for Mac, Windows, Linux
- Automatically uses GPU if available
- Extremely memory-efficient

### Microsoft Agent Framework: Where the Magic Happens

[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) is your playground for building AI agents that can:

- 💬 Chat and remember what you talked about
- 🛠️ Use custom tools (like searching the web or checking the weather)
- 🧠 Think step-by-step through complex problems
- 🤝 Collaborate with other agents as a team
- 🔌 Connect to different AI providers (OpenAI, Ollama, Azure)

**Building blocks:**
- **Agents**: AI assistants with specific jobs
- **Tools**: Special abilities you give them
- **Memory**: So they don't forget your conversations
- **Reasoning**: Teach them to think, not just respond

## Your Training Montage: 4 Tasks

### Task 1: Create Your First Agent

📓 [Open Notebook](../../code/01.BasicAgent/00.BasicAgent-agent.ipynb)

**Task**: Build Alex, your podcast scriptwriting AI. Alex needs to generate a conversation between two hosts discussing tech topics.

**You will learn:**
- How to wake up your AI agent (easier than getting up on Monday)
- Give it personality and instructions
- Have it produce a real podcast script
- Understand its replies to you

**Victory condition**: Alex creates a script for your "Future Bytes" AI pilot episode! 🎯

### Task 2: Give Alex Superpowers (Tools!)

📓 [Open Notebook](../../code/01.BasicAgent/01.BasicAgent-tools.ipynb)

**Task**: Alex is smart, but it doesn’t know the weather today or the time. Let’s fix that by giving it tools!

**You will learn:**
- Create custom Python functions as "tools"
- Let Alex decide *when* to use which tool
- Watch it solve problems autonomously
- Combine multiple tools for complex tasks

**Victory condition**: Ask "What’s the weather in Tokyo?" and Alex figures it out on its own! ☁️

### Task 3: Teach Alex to Think

📓 [Open Notebook](../../code/01.BasicAgent/02.BasicAgent-reasoning.ipynb)

**Task**: Have Alex show its work. When solving problems, you want to see *how* it thinks, not just the answer.

**You will learn:**
- Activate "reasoning mode" (like showing your work in math class)
- See Alex’s step-by-step thought process
- Understand chain-of-thought prompts
- Debug when Alex gets confused

**Victory condition**: Ask a tricky math question and watch Alex think it through! 🧠

### Task 4: Connect Alex to the Internet

📓 [Open Notebook](../../code/01.BasicAgent/03.BasicAgent-websearch.ipynb)

**Task**: Alex’s knowledge has an expiration date. Let’s hook it up to the web for live info!

**You will learn:**
- Build a custom web search tool
- Integrate external APIs
- Gracefully handle web errors
- Get info beyond Alex’s training data

**Victory condition**: Ask about today’s tech news and get the latest results! 📰

## Before You Start 🚀

**Must-haves**:
- Python 3.10+ installed
- Ollama running (check with `ollama --version`)
- VS Code with Python extension
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for smooth experience)

## Task Order

Complete notebooks in order for the full experience:

1. [00.BasicAgent-agent.ipynb](../../code/01.BasicAgent/00.BasicAgent-agent.ipynb) — Meet Alex (your first agent)
2. [01.BasicAgent-tools.ipynb](../../code/01.BasicAgent/01.BasicAgent-tools.ipynb) — Time to upgrade!
3. [02.BasicAgent-reasoning.ipynb](../../code/01.BasicAgent/02.BasicAgent-reasoning.ipynb) — Teach Alex to think
4. [03.BasicAgent-websearch.ipynb](../../code/01.BasicAgent/03.BasicAgent-websearch.ipynb) — Unlock internet access!

## What You’ll Master

After Act 1, you’ll be able to:

- ✅ Run AI models on your own hardware (no cloud required!)
- ✅ Build agents with custom personalities and skills
- ✅ Equip agents with tools to solve real problems
- ✅ Have agents explain their reasoning
- ✅ Connect agents to external data sources
- ✅ Debug when things go wrong

## When Things Go Wrong (And How to Fix) 🔧

### "Alex won’t load! Out of memory!"
**Fix**: Your computer is struggling. Try closing other apps or switch to a smaller model. 8GB RAM is minimum.

### "Alex is too slow"
**Fix**: Enable GPU acceleration in Ollama settings. Or reduce context window size. Speed demon mode engaged! 🏎️

### "Tools don’t work!"
**Fix**: Double-check your function signatures. Alex needs correct type hints to understand the tools. Think of it as giving clear instructions.

## Next Up: Act 2 🎬

You have an agent. But what if you have a *team* of agents working together? In Act 2, you’ll build a complete podcast production team:
- **Research Agent**: Finds the best sources
- **Writing Agent**: Crafts the perfect script
- **Editing (you!)**: Approves or requests changes

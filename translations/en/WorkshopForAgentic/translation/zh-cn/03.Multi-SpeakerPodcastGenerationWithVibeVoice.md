![lab3](../../../../../translated_images/en/lab3.b009c55c4442250b.webp)

## The Grand Finale

You have researched the topic. You have written the script. Now it’s time to add the finishing touch: turn your text into real podcast audio with lifelike voices!

Enter **VibeVoice** — Microsoft Research’s open-source TTS (Text-to-Speech) magic that creates:
- 🎭 Natural and smooth conversations
- 👥 Multiple speakers (up to 4!)
- ⏱️ Long-form audio (up to 90 minutes!)
- 🎵 Expressive delivery (not robot voices!)

This is the tech behind synthetic podcasts. Let’s make yours!

## What is VibeVoice? (Cool Stuff)

VibeVoice is a gift from Microsoft Research to the world. It’s specially designed for podcast-style conversational audio.

### Why It’s Awesome 🔥

* **⏱️ Marathon Sessions**: generate up to 90 minutes of continuous speech (that’s a full podcast episode!)
* **👥 Multi-speaker Magic**: up to 4 distinct voices with consistent personalities
* **⚡ Super Efficient**: uses an ultra-low 7.5 Hz frame rate to save compute
* **🧠 Smart Audio**: combines LLMs (context understanding) and diffusion models (create realistic audio)
* **🎭 Natural Flow**: automatically handles turn-taking, pauses, and conversational pacing

**Translation**: VibeVoice doesn’t just read your script — it *performs* it like a human.

## Before You Start 🚀

**What you need**:

* 🐍 **Python 3.10+** (you already have this from Act 1 and 2)
* 🚀 **uv** (a fast Python package manager — we’ll install it)
* 📝 **Your script**: the `podcast.txt` file from Act 2 (under `../03.Application/`)

**Pro Tip**: this step requires a good internet connection to download pretrained models. Grab a coffee! ☕

## Let’s Go! The Easy Way 🎬

We made this super simple. One shell script does it all.

### The process

1. **Make it executable**:
```bash
chmod +x run_vibe_voice.sh
```

2. **Run it**:
```bash
./run_vibe_voice.sh
```

3. **Wait for magic** (first run may take a few minutes)

### What’s Happening Behind the Scenes 🎭

The script is basically your automated audio engineer:

1. **📥 Download VibeVoice**: clone the official repo from GitHub
2. **📦 Install dependencies**: lightning-fast package install with `uv pip`
3. **🎬 Generate audio**: run inference script using:
   * `--model_path`: pretrained VibeVoice-7B model
   * `--txt_path`: your `podcast.txt` script
   * `--speaker_names`: assign voices (default: Xinran and Anchen)

**Result**: your script turns into a real podcast episode! 🎉

## Your Mission 🎯

Let’s have some fun:

### Task 1: Create Content
Edit `../03.Application/podcast.txt` with a dialogue between two people. Make it about tech, hobbies, anything! Just keep it conversational.

**Format example**:
```
说话人 1：嘿！你听说新的 AI 模型了吗？
说话人 2：不会吧！告诉我更多！
说话人 1：它叫...
```

### Task 2: Generate Audio
Run the script and watch the magic happen. The first time will take longer (model download).

### Task 3: Listen and Analyze
- Does it sound natural?
- Are the speakers distinct voices?
- Are turn-taking smooth?
- Any robotic moments?

### Task 4: Experiment (for the brave)
Edit `run_vibe_voice.sh` and change `--speaker_names` to try different voice combinations. VibeVoice has multiple pretrained voices!

**Bonus challenge**: try a 3-speaker conversation! 🎆
